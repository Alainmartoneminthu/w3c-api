    <p>
        Webhooks allow you to subscribe to certain events happening at W3C. When one of these events is triggered, we'll
        send a HTTP POST payload to the webhook's configured URL.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can configure your webhooks from <a href="https://www.w3.org/users/myprofile/webhooks">your profile</a>.
    </p>

<section id="events">
    <h2>Events</h2>

    <p>
        When configuring a webhook, you can choose which events you would like to receive payloads for. You can change
        the subscribed events through the UI anytime.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each event corresponds to a certain set of actions that can happen. For
        example, if you subscribe to the publication event you'll receive detailed payloads every time a technical
        report
        is published.
    </p>

    <p>The available events are:</p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Publication (tr.published, tr.updated)</td>
            <td>Any time a technical report is published or its metadata are updated</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Group Participation (group.participant_joined, group.participant_left)</td>
            <td>Any time someone joins or leaves a group</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Connected Accounts (connected_account.created, connected_account.deleted)</td>
            <td>Any time someone connects their W3C account to an external service such as GitHub, or removes such a
                connection
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>This list of events will be progressively augmented.</p>
</section>

<section id="headers-payloads">
    <h2>Headers and Payloads</h2>

    <p>HTTP requests made to your webhook's configured URL endpoint will contain several special headers:</p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Header</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>X-W3C-Webhook</td>
            <td>Link to the webhook that triggered the delivery</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>X-W3C-Webhook-Id</td>
            <td>ID of the webhook that triggered the delivery</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>X-W3C-Webhook-Signature-256</td>
            <td>
                Signature of the payload, if a secret token was set.
                <a href="#securing">See below for more information</a>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>X-W3C-Webhook-Signature-256-Base64</td>
            <td>
                Signature of the payload encoded in base64, if a secret token was set.
                <a href="#securing">See below for more information</a>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
        Payload of HTTP requests consists in a JSON fragment including the event that triggered the webhook, the exact
        time when the request was made,
        and one or several objects serialized in the same way as the <a href="https://api.w3.org/doc">API</a>.

<section id="securing">
    <h2>Securing your webhooks</h2>
    <p>
        For security reasons, you probably want to limit requests to those coming from W3C. To do so you can set up a
        secret token and validate the information received.
    </p>

    <h3>Setting your secret token</h3>
    <p>
        When creating or editing a webhook, you can fill out the Secret textbox. You should use a random key with high
        entropy, for example by taking the output of <code>LC_ALL=C tr -dc '[:alnum:]' < /dev/urandom | head -c20</code>
        from the terminal (on a GNU/Linux system).
    </p>

    <p>
        Beware that once set, you won't be able to see this secret anymore. If you forget it, you will have to change
        it,
        which can be done when editing a webhook.
    </p>

    <h3>Validating payloads</h3>
    <p>
        When your secret token is set, W3C uses it to create a hash signature with each payload. This hexadecimal
        hash signature is included with the headers of each request as <code>X-W3C-Webhook-Signature-256</code>.
        We also send a Base 64 version of the signature as <code>X-W3C-Webhook-Signature-256-Base64</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        To verify that this signature is correct, and thus that it indeed came from W3C, you need to compute hash using
        an HMAC hex digest, with the SHA-256 algorithm, and then compare this hash with the signature.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here is a sample PHP code exhibiting how to verify the signature:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-php">&lt;?php
$body = file_get_contents('php://input');
$secret = $_ENV['SECRET_TOKEN'];
$signature = hash_hmac('sha256', $body, $secret);
if (hash_equals($signature, $_SERVER['HTTP_X_W3C_WEBHOOK_SIGNATURE_256'])) {
   echo 'ok';
} else {
  http_response_code(403);
}</code></pre>
    <p>
        Your language and server implementations may differ from this example code. However, there are a few important
        things to point out:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Never hardcode the secret token into your app! Use environment variables or other secure means to expose the
            token to your app.
        </li>
        <li>
            Avoid using <code>==</code> to compare the signature with the computed hash. Instead, use a method like
            <code>hash_equals</code> to perform a timing attack safe string comparison.
        </li>
    </ul>
